## Happy to meet you !

Looking for information about me ? Here is my resume :

- Background: I am a statistician & quantitative geneticist by training, and a software developer by experience, with expertise in statistical genetics, including GWAS, haplotype association mapping, genomic prediction, and 
optimization of breeding schemes. I also bring experience from both the medical and energy industries, where I have applied my skills to solve complex, real-world challenges. 


- Interests: Solve complex scientific problems and translate them into actionable solutions by leveraging scientific knowledge and cutting-edge programming languages and technologies, such as Python, TensorFlow, 
Keras, R, R Shiny, and AWS, in fields like quantitative genetics, breeding, and industrial applications. 

- Scientific software contributions:

  - I developed [WISER](https://github.com/ljacquin/wiser) (to be published soon) to enhance phenotype estimation per genotype in experimental designs by correcting for population structure, resulting in more accurate GWAS and genomic predictions through improved genetic variance estimation.
  -  I developed the R package [KRMM](https://github.com/ljacquin/wiser) for solving RKHS regression, used by teams of INRAE and CIRAD for genomic prediction and analyses, which competes with current implementations of SVM, random forests and neural networks within the omic framework. I also developed the [KHAMIX](https://github.com/ljacquin/khamix) software for haplotype-based association mapping.
  -  I developed the [Prio Retino+](https://gaiha.org/fr/prioretino/) approach for a start-up named Good AI Health Assistant (GAIHA), based on deep convolutional neural networks, which allows automated referable diabetic retinopathy 
detection. This approach has been benchmarked with another approach cleared by the FDA in the USA and allows; 1) fast, 2) massive and 3) regular screening and follow-up of patients. The [Prio Retino+](https://gaiha.org/fr/prioretino/) is currently used by a [World Health Organization (WHO) Center in Dakar](https://abassndao.business.site/) 

- Current position: I am currently serving as a postdoctoral researcher and engineer, on a fixed-term contract at IRHS (INRAE, Angers), actively engaged in the AppleBIOME project within the ResPOM team. My focus is 
on enhancing the resistance of both apple and pear trees against biotic stressors.  Additionally, I hold the role of CTO at GAIHA.
